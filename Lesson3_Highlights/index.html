            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GitHub is an online code hosting platform for version control systems or VCS's. More specifically, GitHub is a distributed version control system or DVCS meaning that it allows full access to ever file, branch, and iteration of a project and allows every user involved with the DVCS access to a full & self-contained history of the changes made on a project. GitHub or rather DVCS's have another benefit. Unlike the centralized version control systems (CVCS's), DVCS's don't need a constant connection to a central repository. DVCS's allow developers/development teams to work anywhere and allow collaboration asynchronously from any time zone. In terms of relevance, I would put this at No.1. While Lesson 3 is about version control systems in general, the lesson is more focused on the Git VCS specifically as we are learning about VCS's through GitHub. </p>

            <p class="lead">In this portion, the class was assigned to read through the comprehension to get a better understanding of version control, VCS's, and Git. We read an introduction to  version control, a brief history in Git, the basics of Git, how to get a git repository, recording the changes to a repository, and setting up an account for GitHub. This is a very important key concept of the lesson as this week is all about version control and Git. Learn about the how a repository works and how  to manage one. As well as some of the basic commands to get an understanding of Git, such as commit, add, push, branch, checkout, and more.  </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In this portion of lesson 3, we contiuned learning about version control and Git in one of the best ways possible, through experience. We were given three interactive excercises to go through. Visualizing basic git commands, basic git commands, and git calisthenics (though this last one is optional). Going over the first excercise, we went through some of the basics of git. Basic commands, undo commit commands, combining branches commands, and remote server commands, as well as some example situations with Git and a blank canvas to try from scratch. And the second excercise partook in in the basics of Git through interactive exercises, but also provided an introduction to GitHub and a list of Git commands. In terms of relevance, I would put this very high as it allows to not to better understand version control and Git, but also gives us a chance to try it out and get a feeling for use Git.</p>

            <p class="lead">This infographic titled 'Learn Git 7 Minutes' shows an explanation into how Git works. But it also shows the git cycle and the steps taken during the process. The git cycle is shown through a diagram of a centralized version control system. The cycle starts out with files from the working directory on a developer's computer, then the files and changes made are initialized and given a remote origin, and then sent into a local reposity on the developer's computer then added and staged. The files and changes are then commited into the local repository and pushed into a remote repository. The files can then be accessed from another developer's computer via the git clone command as well as a git pull command to bring the files into another their local repository, where the files are then staged, commited and pushed back to the remote repository. And the cycle repeats. In terms of relevance, I should probably put this higher on the list. </p>

            <p class="lead"> (I said it for the last one, I'll say for this one as well, I should probably put this higher on the relevancy list like probably No.1 on the list. Oh well.) Version control systems or VCS's are repositories that store all files, changes, and revisions made on a project. VCS's allow members of a developement team to check out the files in a project make changes/revisions to the files, then checked back into the repository. VCS's have many benefits, for instance, they automatically notes who made the revisions, when revisions were made, what changes were made, and any merges made to the same file. VCS's also allow the ability to keep files on a remote repository as well as allow multiple people to work on same files simultaneously without conflict. VCS's allow you to revert back to an older version of project, and even backup the files so there won't be a need to restart a project if work is lost.</p>
